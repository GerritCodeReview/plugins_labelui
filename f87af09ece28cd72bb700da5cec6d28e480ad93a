Now that we expose Everything from reviewdb-client and *Info classes from gerrit-gwtui I got a crazy idea:\n\nExpose ChangeScreenExtensionPoint as dedicated extension point and allow plugin to hijack the change screen as whole. With this extension point, a plugin can add ChangeScreenType back and offer DEFAULT, LEGACY implementation and restore the old change screen code incarnation (or re-implement it from scratch) and provide:\n\n  gerrit-legacy-change-screen-plugin",
